<h1>Python Engineer Code Exercise</h1>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Once you receive these instructions, we'd like you to deliver your solution or partial solution within 24 hours.</li>
	<li>Retrieve the html SEC filing from 
			<a href='http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/9092/000000909214000004/bmi-20131231x10k.htm'>
							 http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/9092/000000909214000004/bmi-20131231x10k.htm
			</a>
	</li>
	<li>Please produce the following, to two separate txt files:
		<ol type='A'>
			<li>A text version of the filing (at least partially formatted) [ document.txt ]</li>
			<li>A list of paragraphs, excluding text in tables, from the filing that contain a dollar sign, plus the paragraph start index and the paragraph index in the text document from step A. [ paragraphs.txt ]</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ol>
<li>Source code (excluding libraries)</li>
<li>README containing
	<ol type='A'>
		<li>Brief description of your approach to the problem</li>
		<li>Approximate amount of time you spent working on your solution</li>
		<li>List of any libraries used, including version information</li>
		<li>Instructions for running</li>
		<li>Location of output files (document.txt and paragraphs.txt)</li>
	</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Submission</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Please submit your solution by sharing a git repo containing the deliverables listed above with us via either github or bitbucket.</li>
	<li>You can share it via github by following the instructions <a href='https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/'>here</a> and adding 
			username [removed].</li>
	<li>You can share it via bitbucket by following the instructions <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qvN_LPnph4'>in this video</a> and sharing with username [removed].</li>
	<li>Please also send an email to [removed] to let him know you've submitted your solution.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Grading (not in order of importance)</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Code style</li>
	<li>Leveraging of libraries</li>
	<li>Correctness of solution</li>
	<li>Generality of solution (we will apply this solution to other sec filings and see how well it performs)</li>
	<li>Run speed of solution</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol>
	<li>We expect you to spend 2-4 hours on this project. If you get to the time limit and have a partially working solution, please submit it. We want to get an idea of how you approach the problem, and completion isn't necessarily a requirement for that.</li>
	<li>Conversion of html version of the filing to a text version of the filing is required.</li>
	<li>Your solution must be runnable in Python3 (we are using Python 3.4)</li>
	<li>This test simulates an in-house use case, so we will compare your solution to ours.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example Output for paragraphs.txt file</h2>
<p>
<pre>
