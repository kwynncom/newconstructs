MORE ON LIBRARIES

I used 4 import commands

import codecs
import json
from html.parser import HTMLParser
from collections import OrderedDict

codecs - used to Parse Windows-1252 charset, as discussed in errors_encountered.txt
json - the required output per the exercise
HTMLParser - discussed in README
	Also see   https://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.html
OrderedDict - below

********
OrderedDict LIBRARY

I had JSON sorting my output keys in an order other than text, start, end.  I found an 
example for this, and it worked.
