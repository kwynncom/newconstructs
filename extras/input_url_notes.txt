URL / INPUT NOTES / THE URL ERROR

The input_1_kwynn.html file is from 

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/9092/000000909214000004/bmi-20131231x10k.htm

The New Constructs instructions give this URL:  http://goo.gl/UL5o3

That takes me to something completely different.  (I will refrain from speculating as to why this is for now.)

For a more detailed record, the document is:
