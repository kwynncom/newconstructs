Besides the requested A - E below, I will likely write an "extras" file (or some such name) with extra notes.


A. APPROACH ************

I used the Python HTMLParser library, v3.4.

For my subclass of HTMLParser, I needed a handful of variables to keep track of:

* The text version of the file (written to document.txt)
* Whether or not I'm in a table, based on a flag switched by start / end HTML TABLE tags
* The "leaf" / inner text / node text (no HTML left) of a particular DIV, written to documents.txt and the "text" field of 
	paragraphs.txt
* The starting index of the div text (in terms of characters into the documents.txt file)
* the paragraph array for paragraphs.txt (ultimately written as JSON)

Besides __init__ of the variables, I had 3 methods to keep track of start tags, end tags, and data (text).

That largely covers it.


B. TIME ****************

Roughly 4 hours.


C. LIBRARIES *****

All version 3.4.  The major import command was:

from html.parser import HTMLParser

I discuss the other libraries in my "extras" file.  The rest were incidental.


D. INSTRUCTIONS / RUNNING / EXECUTION *********

I used the 3.4.0 python3 interpreter in Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS).

* Change the input file at the top of the .py file (current newconstructs.py)
	You may use a full path.  I am doing no path manipulation to interfere.
* Save the change (probably obvious, but one should be specific)
* From the command line: 
python3 newconstructs.py

There is no stdout output, only the two files requested.

For sake of comparison and debugging, it's taking roughly 1 second, and less than 2 seconds, to run the sample file.  
I feel safe in saying I'm on a slow computer.

E. OUTPUT *********

The two output files are written to the same directory as the PY (.py) file.
