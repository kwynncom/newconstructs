*** NEW APPROACH ***

The output is identical to the previous version, and I understand the previous version was verified as correct by New Constructs.

I eliminated the n-squared algorithm where I unnecessarily called "len()" on my whole document / file text string.  I now call "len()" on an 'n' (linear) basis rather than n-squared.  

I did this with a new, second class ("docClass") to keep track of paragraph and document lengths and strings.

With the new object, I also reduced dollar-sign seeks.  

I also reduced the complexity of the original "MyHTMLParser" class.  This class should now be doing almost precisely what it should do--no more, no less.
